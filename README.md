Encryption Playground : 2016
============================

Small encryption / hashing example I did in JS

## [Demo](https://encryption-playground.herokuapp.com/index.html)

## Postulat

* SHA256 cannot be reverted
* RSA signatures can be trusted
* The Genesis transaction user private key cannot be found (based on the genesis transaction signature for example)
