            <h1>Rewarding transactions validation</h1>

            <p>In order to incentive people to participate to mining we could reward them with few potato coins that we will create out of nowhere!</p>

            <p>This will have two benefits: Provided the potato-coin reward is large enough that will give them an incentive to participate in validation
            and grow the number of people mining. And that will also help injecting a bit of potato-coins in the network, bootstraping our crypto-currency!</p>

            <p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">In the Bitcoin protocol, this validation process is called <b>mining</b>. For each block of transactions validated, the
            successful miner receives a bitcoin reward. Initially, this was set to be a 50 bitcoin reward. But for every 210,000
            validated blocks (roughly, once every four years) the reward halves. This has happened just once, to date, and so the
            current reward for mining a block is 25 bitcoins. This halving in the rate will continue every four years until the
            year 2140 CE. At that point, the reward for mining will drop below 10^{-8} bitcoins per block. 10^{-8} bitcoins is
            actually the minimal unit of Bitcoin, and is known as a <i>satoshi</i>. So in 2140 CE the total supply of bitcoins will cease
            to increase. However, that won‚Äôt eliminate the incentive to help validate transactions. Bitcoin also makes it possible
            to set aside some currency in a transaction as a transaction fee, which goes to the miner who helps validate it.
            In the early days of Bitcoin transaction fees were mostly set to zero, but as Bitcoin has gained in popularity,
            transaction fees have gradually risen, and are now a substantial additional incentive on top of the 25 bitcoin reward
            for mining a block.</div></p>

            <p>You can think of proof-of-work as a competition to approve transactions. Each entry in the competition costs a
            little bit of computing power. A miner‚Äôs chance of winning the competition is (roughly, and with some caveats)
            equal to the proportion of the total computing power that they control. So, for instance, if a miner controls
            one percent of the computing power being used to validate Bitcoin transactions, then they have roughly a one
            percent chance of winning the competition. So provided a lot of computing power is being brought to bear on the
            competition, a dishonest miner is likely to have only a <b>relatively small chance to corrupt the validation process</b>,
            unless they expend a huge amount of computing resources.</p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>In our example let's state that the mining of a block of 10 transactions is rewarded with <b>25 potato-coins</b></p>

            <b>TOOOODDDOOOOO</b>

            <h2>Demonstration</h2>
            <article class="card" id="transaction-block">
                <div class="card-block">
                    <ol style="opacity: 0;">
                        <li>Transaction message:
                            <code class="transaction"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li>Alice will then sign the message with her private key:
                            <code class="signed-message"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li>Bob can then verify that the message is from Alice by checking the signature, check that the hash is valid and that he
                        cannot be found in his local blockchain, he finds that is is:
                            <code class="verify-message"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li>But Bob do not consider the transaction "verified" yet. He will broadcast this message to all users in his network
                        that will verify it and add it to there pending "unverified" transactions</li>

                        <li>When enough transaction will have been receive by mining-users, they will start brute-forcing
                        for a hash of a block of transaction including Alice one. This hash will have to start with three zeros.</li>

                        <li>As soon as one user will have found such hash of a block he will proudly broadcast it to the network, <b>this block will start
                        with a transaction rewarding him with 25 potato-coins.</b></li>

                        <li>Bob (and other users) will check for the hash and and the content of the block, if it is a valid they will add the block to their blockchain
                        considering it "verified"</li>

                        <li>Bob being aware of that can now give Alice the potato she bought him.
                    </ol>

            </article>

            <button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="aliceSend1CoinToBob()">Make Alice send one coin to Bob üòá</button><br><br>

            <h2>Flaw</h2>

            <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">The network is not converging on one version of the blockchain</div>

            <p>Let's say two users that have successfully validated the same block ans send it on the network at the same time,
            What will probably happen is that part of the network will ned-up with a version of the blockchain where the first user
            validated the block and was rewarded for that, and part of the network will consider that it's the second user that
            have been rewarded</p>

            <p>Also, while it‚Äôs encouraging that a dishonest party has only a relatively small chance to corrupt the
            block chain, that‚Äôs not enough to give us confidence in the currency.</p>
