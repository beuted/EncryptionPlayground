            <h1>Rewarding transactions validation</h1>

            <p>Alright, let‚Äôs suppose Dylan is lucky and finds a suitable nonce, <code>x</code>. Celebration! (He‚Äôll be rewarded for finding
            the nonce, as described below). He broadcasts the block of transactions he‚Äôs approving to the network, together with
            the value for <code>x</code>. Other participants in the potato-coin network can verify that <code>x</code> is a valid solution
            to the proof-of-work puzzle. And they then update their block chains to include the new block of transactions.</p>

            <p>For the proof-of-work idea to have any chance of succeeding, network users need an incentive to help validate transactions.
            Without such an incentive, they have no reason to expend valuable computational power, merely to help validate other people‚Äôs
            transactions. And if network users are not willing to expend that power, then the whole system won‚Äôt work. The solution to
            this problem is to reward people who help validate transactions. In particular, suppose we reward whoever successfully
            validates a block of transactions by crediting them with some potato-coins. Provided the potato-coin reward is large enough
            that will give them an incentive to participate in validation.</p>

            <p><div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">In the Bitcoin protocol, this validation process is called <b>mining</b>. For each block of transactions validated, the
            successful miner receives a bitcoin reward. Initially, this was set to be a 50 bitcoin reward. But for every 210,000
            validated blocks (roughly, once every four years) the reward halves. This has happened just once, to date, and so the
            current reward for mining a block is 25 bitcoins. This halving in the rate will continue every four years until the
            year 2140 CE. At that point, the reward for mining will drop below 10^{-8} bitcoins per block. 10^{-8} bitcoins is
            actually the minimal unit of Bitcoin, and is known as a <i>satoshi</i>. So in 2140 CE the total supply of bitcoins will cease
            to increase. However, that won‚Äôt eliminate the incentive to help validate transactions. Bitcoin also makes it possible
            to set aside some currency in a transaction as a transaction fee, which goes to the miner who helps validate it.
            In the early days of Bitcoin transaction fees were mostly set to zero, but as Bitcoin has gained in popularity,
            transaction fees have gradually risen, and are now a substantial additional incentive on top of the 25 bitcoin reward
            for mining a block.</div></p>

            <p>You can think of proof-of-work as a competition to approve transactions. Each entry in the competition costs a
            little bit of computing power. A miner‚Äôs chance of winning the competition is (roughly, and with some caveats)
            equal to the proportion of the total computing power that they control. So, for instance, if a miner controls
            one percent of the computing power being used to validate Bitcoin transactions, then they have roughly a one
            percent chance of winning the competition. So provided a lot of computing power is being brought to bear on the
            competition, a dishonest miner is likely to have only a relatively small chance to corrupt the validation process,
            unless they expend a huge amount of computing resources.</p>

            <p>In our example let's state that the mining of a block of 10 transactions is rewarded with <b>25 potato-coins</b></p>

            <article class="card" id="transaction-block" style="display: none;">
                <div class="card-block">
                    <ol style="margin: 0;">
                        <li><b>Transaction message:</b>
                            <code class="transaction"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Alice will then sign the message with her private key:</b>
                            <code class="signed-message"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Bob can then verify that the message is from Alice by checking the signature, check that the hash is valid and that he
                        cannot be found in his local blockchain, he finds that is is:</b>
                            <code class="verify-message"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>But Bob do not consider the transaction "verified" yet. He will broadcast this message to all users in his network and ask them to verify the transaction</b>

                        <li><b>Users will respond to Bob that the message is correct considering their current blockchain</b></li>

                        <li><b>Bob can now give Alice the potato she bought him.</b>
                    </ol>
                </div>                
            </article>

            <button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="aliceSend1CoinToBob()">Make Alice send one coin to Bob üòá</button><br><br>

            <p><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" onclick="makeDylanMine()">Make Dylan start mining</button></p>

            <p>Of course, while it‚Äôs encouraging that a dishonest party has only a relatively small chance to corrupt the
            block chain, that‚Äôs not enough to give us confidence in the currency. In particular, we haven‚Äôt yet conclusively
            addressed the issue of double spending.</p>
