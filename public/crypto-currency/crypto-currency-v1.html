                    <p>For these examples we are going to consider the following simple problem: Alice wants to buy a potato from Bob
                    for 1 potato-Coin, <b>How can Alice transfers 1 potato-Coin to Bob?</b> Both users will have a private and
                    a public key that will allow them to sign messages.</p>
                    
                    <p>The asymmetric encryption system we will use is RSA (we <a href="file:///E:/src/repos/EncryptionPlayground/pages/rsa.html">
                    implemented a simple one here</a>) but we will need a deeper implementation that supports encryption/decryption of large amounts of
                    data and of strings as well as a signing implementation, so we will use <code>jsrsasign</code> for that.</p>

            <h2 class="h2">Implementation</h2>
            <p>Let's define a user on the network like so:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/beuted/1acccf7063e8d595b78cb053f452fdbd.js"></script>
            
            <p>A user is defined by his private-key, that he keep secret, and his identity can be checked using his public-key. He also keeps a complete record,
            and this is important, of <b>all transactions</b> he has ever witness. This allows him to be aware of who owns how many coins on the network.
            Finally he keeps an address-book up to date with all the people he knows on the network.</p>

            <p>This can seem pretty heavy but you have to keep in mind that in the crypto-currency we are trying to build we don't want any Bank or central authority.
            This changes the nature of the currency considerably. It means that there is no longer any single organization in charge of the currency. And when
            you think about the enormous power a central bank has – control over the money supply – that’s a pretty huge change.
            The price to pay is that every user needs to be aware other users and how much they own.</p>

            <p>Now let's imagine, Alice wants to buy a potato to Bob for 1 potato-coin. She will have to create a simple message with the
            amount of money she wants to give bob and the current date, sign it and send it on the network.</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/beuted/ccaaf463a162bbe527825dfdf572c81a.js"></script>

            <p>Bob would receive it, validate that the signature is correct, that Alice have enough coins to pay him (thanks to the list of
            <b>all the transactions</b> on the network he keeps up to date) and if this is the case he will call it a deal and give the potato to Alice.</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/beuted/a65a25a8707f1604d4e1c1648493e32e.js"></script>

            <p>Other users on the network will see this transaction as well and update their list of transaction, they will now know that Bob has -1 potato-coin
            and that Alice have +1 potato-coin</p>
            

            <h2 class="h2">Demonstration</h2>

            <article>
                <div class="card" id="transaction-block">
                    <div class="card-block">
                        <ol style="opacity: 0;">
                            <li>Alice builds the transaction message:
                                <code class="transaction"></code>
                            </li>

                            <li>Alice will then sign the message with her private key:
                                <code class="signed-message"></code>
                            </li>

                            <li>Bob can then verify that the message is from Alice by checking the signature, he finds that it is:
                                <code class="verify-message"></code>
                            </li>

                            <li>Bob will broadcast this message to all users proving that he now owns +1 coin and Alice -1, and give a potato to Alice.
                        </ol>

                <p>As the transaction have been signed with Alice private key, we can know for sure that Alice is OK with the transaction. So if this encrypted transaction
                is broadcast on the network, everybody will be aware that Bob now have +1 coin and Alice -1 coin.</p>
