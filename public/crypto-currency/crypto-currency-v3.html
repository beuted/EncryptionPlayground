            <h1 class="h1">Agreement on the state of the transaction list</h1>

            <p>How can we address the problem of double spending? The obvious solution is that when Bob sends
            Alice a potato-coin, <b>Alice shouldn’t try to verify the transaction alone</b>. Rather, she should broadcast the
            possible transaction to the entire network of potato-coins users, and ask them to help determine whether
            the transaction is legitimate. If they collectively decide that the transaction is okay, then Alice can
            accept the potato-coin, and everyone will update their transaction list. This type of protocol can help prevent
            timing attacks. Since, if Bob tries to spend his potato-coin with both Alice and Charlie, other people on
            the network will notice, and network users will tell both Alice and Charlie that there is a problem with
            the transaction, and the transaction shouldn’t go through.</p>

            <p>In more detail, let’s suppose Bob wants to give Alice a potato-coin. As before, he signs the message and gives the signed message to Alice.
            Also, as before, Alice does a sanity check, using his copy of the transaction list to check that, indeed, the coin
            currently belongs to Alice. But at that point the protocol is modified. Alice doesn’t just go ahead and accept
            the transaction. Instead, she broadcasts Bob’s message to the entire network. Other members of the network
            will do the same checks with <b>their version of the transaction list</b>, if they find the transaction valid they will
            broadcast this "check" of the network. Once enough people have broadcast that message,
            everyone updates their transaction list to show that Bob has -1 coin and Alice +1.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">We are reaching here the issue that have stayed unsolved for about 30 years until somebody under the nickname of
            Satoshi Nakamoto published <a href = "https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">a paper on the subject</a> in 2008 that will
            solve this issue and truly remove the "trusted 3rd party".</div>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>

            <p>Let's say we consider a transaction to be verified when <b>50% of users in the network</b> responded saying that the transaction is correct.</p>

            <p>The user will have to store, for each "serial numbers" (hash of the message), a list of user that have validated the transaction: <code>localTransactionValidators</code></p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/beuted/498c5598c3a1212ec842e10fa3483072.js"></script>

            <p>Then we're going to add a last step to the previous function <code>VerifySignedMessageAndAddToSignedMessageList</code> broadcasting that the message is valid
            to all other users if user find it valid.</p>

            <h2>Demonstration</h2>

            <article class="card" id="transaction-block">
                <div class="card-block">
                    <ol style="opacity: 0;">
                        <li><b>Transaction message:</b>
                            <code class="transaction"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Alice will then sign the message with her private key:</b>
                            <code class="signed-message"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Bob can then verify that the message is from Alice by checking the signature, check that the hash is valid and that he
                        cannot be found in his local transaction list, he finds that is is:</b>
                            <code class="verify-message"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>But Bob do not consider the transaction "verified" yet. He will broadcast this message to all users in his network and ask them to verify the transaction</b>

                        <li><b>Users will respond to Bob that the message is correct considering their current list of transactions</b></li>

                        <li><b>Bob can now give Alice the potato she bought him.</b>
                    </ol>
                </div>                
            </article>

            <button class="btn btn-success" onclick="window.aliceSend1CoinToBob()">Make Alice send one coin to Bob <i class="fa fa-exchange" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><br><br>
            

            <h3>Timing attacks?</h3>

            <p>Timing attack will not work anymore since Alice and Charlie will now be able to agree on which transaction is valid and which one is not.
            So when Bob will send all his coins to Alice and Charlie at the same time, only one of this transaction will be validated.</p>
            
            <p><button class="btn btn-warning" onclick="window.broadcastSimultaneousMessages()">Simultaneously send two messages giving all Bob's money to Alice and Charlie <i class="fa fa-shield" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></p>

            <h2>Flaw</h2>
            <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">This implementation will not work either! (but we're getting close)</div>

            <p>Few issues comes with what we just described here:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Alice have no way to know how many people in the network there is, so she have no way to know what
                <b>"50% of the users in the network"</b> is.</li>
                <li>Why a user will bother responding to Alice when she ask if the message she have been sent is valid?</li>                
                <li>Even if she had a way to know, Bob could create billions of fake users and swarm the network with
                puppets that will validate all his transactions.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Indeed let's imagine Bob create 4 Users on 4 differents ip addresses with the following behavior: Eache time they're sent a transaction coming from bob they validate it only if
            the user requesting the validation is the user receiving the coins.</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/beuted/2526b2a9539632665369aff793005149.js"></script>

            <p>The effect would be that users receiving a lot of validations for the transaction benefiting him would consider it as valid and reject the transaction where somebody elso get paid.
            But for the rest of the network it would be the opposite.</p>

            <p><button class="btn btn-danger" onclick="window.swarmNetworkWithBobPuppets()">Swarm the network with bob's puppets <i class="fa fa-bomb" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></p>

            <p>We need a better definition of: <i>“once enough people have broadcast that message”</i> for the currency to work.</p>
