            <h1 class="h1">Using serial numbers to make coins uniquely identifiable</h1>

            <p>What we’d like is a way of making potato-coins unique. They need a label or serial-number to had on the message. So that we know if the exact
            same message is replayed on the network</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/beuted/07e8cf611b941cd44638e93815a6c2be.js"></script>

            <p>To make this scheme work we need a trusted source of serial numbers for the potato-coins. <b>One way to create such a source is
            to introduce a bank</b>. This bank would provide serial numbers for potato-coins, keep track of who has which potato-coins, and verify
            that transactions really are legitimate,</p>

            <h4 class="h4">Where do serial number come from?</h4>

            <p>This solution seems indeed to avoid the "simple double spending" issue but this forces us to trust a bank for the serial numbers.
            Another solution would be to use <b>a hash of the message</b>. Since the message contains a date we can assume that no legit message
            will have the same hash and so we can use this as our serial numbers.</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/beuted/eaf11e52768c3629000ecb585c9937ed.js"></script>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>

            <p>The implementation haven't changed much, we just add a step at message creation and one at message validation.</p>

            <h2>Demonstration</h2>

            <article class="card" id="transaction-block">
                <div class="card-block">
                    <ol style="opacity: 0;">
                        <li><b>Transaction message:</b>
                            <code class="transaction"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Alice will then sign the message with her private key:</b>
                            <code class="signed-message"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Bob can then verify that the message is from Alice by checking the signature, that the hash is valid and that he
                        cannot be found in his local list of transactions twice, he finds that it is:</b>
                            <code class="verify-message"></code>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Bob will broadcast this message to all users, proving that he now owns +1 coin and Alice -1</b>

                        <li><b>Bob can now give Alice the potato she bought him. He can prove that Alice sent him a coin since he has a message signed with her private key</b>
                    </ol>

            <p>As the transaction have been signed with Alice private key we can know for sure that Alice is okay with the transaction and since
            the hash parameter match the hash of the message and is unique on the network we can now for sure that <b>it have not been "replayed"</b></p>

            <h4 class="h4">Simple double emission?</h4>

            <p>This time Bob:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Cannot replay the message 10 times</b> because they will have the same hash:
                <button class="btn btn-warning" onclick="window.broadcastSameMessage()">Try broadcasting the same transaction message <i class="fa fa-shield" aria-hidden="true"></i></button><br>
                </li>
                <li>and he <b>cannot change the message to change the hash</b> because the message will not be signed correctly anymore.
                <button class="btn btn-warning" onclick="window.broadcastDifferentMessages()">Just change the date of the message to change its hash
                (with the same signature) <i class="fa fa-shield" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></li>

            <h2 class="h2">Flaw</h2>

            <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">But this implementation can still be abuse with a timing-attack</div>

            <p>Great, having these hashes as serial numbers we can avoid simple double spending, but we are still weak against
            <i>"timing attacks"</i>, where malicious people spends money they don't have.</p>
            <p>Let's consider that Bob send <b>X coins</b> to Alice, (X being all the coins he has) and <b>at the exact same time</b>,
            send X coins to Charlie.</p>
            <p>What will happen is that Alice will update her local list of transactions with the transaction where Bob gives her all his coins and
            Charlie will update his local list of transactions with a transaction where bob gives him all his coins, and both will give bob X potatoes
            even tho' only one out of Alice and Charlie have been paid.</p>
            <p><button class="btn btn-danger" onclick="window.broadcastSimultaneousMessages()">Simultaneously send two messages giving all Bob's money to Alice and Charlie <i class="fa fa-bomb" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></p>
